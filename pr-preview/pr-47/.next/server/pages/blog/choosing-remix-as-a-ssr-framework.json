{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\n## The Background\n\nWe at Vandebron have a mission to get the news out about [our good work](https://vandebron.nl/missie), and we understand that [Server Side Rendering (SSR)](https://web.dev/articles/rendering-on-the-web#server-side) can really help with that. Among other things, it provides an easy way for search engines to discover our pages, so you, our (future?!) customer, can find them easier. That means more people choosing green energy, and ultimately, a cleaner environment!  ðŸŽ‰\n\n## We rolled our own\n\nThe year was 2017, Covid was still a word that sounded more like a bird than anything else... The world was heating up and Vandebron was 4 years into it's mission to bring 100% renewable energy throughout all of the Netherlands.\n\nAs far as web technologies are concnered, 4 years was ages ago. It was a time when NextJS was less than a year old, and Remix was still several years from coming out. But we needed a way to deliver that high-quality content to all of you. So, the inovators that we were, we decided to build out own SSR framework. In short, we wanted pizza, but there were no pizza shops in town... So we made our own!\n\nIt's been great but not without issue...\n![remix-migration-ugly-window-mock.png](../images/remix-migration-ugly-window-mock.png)\n\n\n## A Short Note: Why Server Side Rendering\n\nYou might not be satisifed with the short explanation of why we picked an SSR framework in the first place. This article isn't really about that - if you're interested in more analysis on when and where to choose an SSR framework, check out these excellent articles from Splunk:\n* [The User Experience (UX) Benefits of SSR](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/server-side-rendering-ssr.html)\n* [The SEO Benefits of SSR](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/server-side-rendering-ssr.html)\n\n## Decisions Made the Right Way - A Comparison\n\nNowdays, there are better, industry standard technologies available! I.e. pizza shops have opened nearby!! Let's find a good one. Of course, you don't want to just go to any spot. Especially if there's more than one shop in town - you'd be silly not to check which one is closest, and look at the menu. Which one has better reviews, is that one very angry customer just upset that there wasn't any anchovies in the vegan pizza shop? What were the expecting anyway?\n<img src=\"../images/remix-migration-vegan-pizza-shop.png\" alt=\"vegan-pizza-shop\" width=\"600\"/>\n\nAt Vandebron we're a React shop so for this reason we limited ourselves to just SSR frameworks supporting React. The choice of one framework over another is of crucial importance, so, as part of our analysis, we built a small part of our [vandebron.nl/blog](https://vandebron.nl/blog) page twice. Two of our engineers then presented these prototypes to our Front End Guild, and this discussion fed heavily into the Architecture Decision Record that we wrote comparing the results.\n\nThe Background for the decision record states this:\n\n> _\"Our Frontend currently uses a custom-built, hard to maintain SSR solution, which we like to replace with a modern and standard library. Possible candidates are NextJS and Remix. The goal is to investigate which one suits our needs best.\"_\n\nYes, there are other options we could have considered but we wanted to stay with a tried-and-tested framework and one that was compatible with our existing React setup.\n![remix-migration-adr-options-considered.png](../images/remix-migration-adr-options-considered.png)\n\nAs you can see, the comparison between the two frameworks was very similar. In the end we favoured the simple, opinionated direction of Remix over that of the more full-featured but potentially complex setup of NextJS. Even though Remix has a smaller community, we attributed this mostly to the age of the framework and not the quality  of the framework itself. Though the Positivity has gone down a bit (as listed in [the 2023 StateOfJS survey](https://2023.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/meta-frameworks/),) the decrease has been relatively minor and in line with most-other frameworks (notable exceptions for Astro and SvelteKit which have both seen big upticks in both Usage and Positivity)\n![State of JS Positivity](../images/remix-migration-sojs-framework-positivity.png)\nFinally, we noted that NextJS is tightly coupled with Vercel. At Vandebron we value platform independence and not getting tied to specific hosting providers or platforms. Remix gives us the independence we're looking for by providing a SSR framework without a potential to be tied into other solutions/platforms in the future.\n\nOutcome\n> _\"Most members favoured Remixâ€™s focus on web standards and usage of standard libraries and were put off (a little) by NextJSâ€™s uncertainty in development direction.\"_\n\n## So, How's it Going?\n\nThe migration effort is still underway but already we can report that it's going quite well - developers are excited to work on the new tech stack because it's seen as a developer-friendly platform and one of the two leading frameworks in the industry. There are some rather interesting points:\n\n### Styling\n\n### Monitoring & Observibility\nSentry seems like it's giving us goofy results\n\n","meta":{"title":"Server-Side-Rendering - An Example Where It's Appropriate","description":"We had our own custom SSR framework.
