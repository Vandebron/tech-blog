Camera-traps are widely used for conservation and monitoring. Being great in taking photos in challenging conditions they lack something very important... Hack the Planet's system modifies existing camera-traps and uses Machine Learning to analyse photos in realtime on-device to detect animals and humans, but could also be used to detech environmental dangers. The system sends alerts to rangers if something of interest was detected. Equipped with a satellite uplink the system can operate anywhere on the globe without any dependency on a GSM / Wifi or Lora network.

In this challenge you can:

1. Use their novel camera-trap setup to detect environmental dangers like forest fires, illegal logging, pollution, or "hack" one of the planets other biggest issues.
2. Develop a new type of camera for the system. Currently an off-the-shelf camera is used, a custom camera would be a preffered option.

**Technology:**

Usage of the camera-trap and its software, access to datasets from previous detected wildlife monitoring
