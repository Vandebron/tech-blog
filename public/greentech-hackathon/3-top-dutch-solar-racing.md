During the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, solar cars race 3000 km through the outback of Australia. Finishing the race successfully requires accurate predictions and monitoring of the car’s performance. There are many aspects to this challenge. The performance can be predicted and optimized based on weather and route data. The car might then drive faster where it’s cloudy and slower where it’s sunny. Also, a significant fraction of the available energy is harvested outside racing hours, in the evening and morning. The amount of energy that can be harvested there must be predicted accurately. Incoming energy might also be maximised through optimisation of the MPPTs, which determine the optimal voltage for the solar cells. For monitoring, an especially relevant parameter is the state of charge of the battery, which must be calculated based on charge flow and the battery’s voltage.

**Technology:**

Datasets are available for the MPPTs and battery. Historic weather data along the route in Australia is available, but solutions should of course also work with new weather predictions.
