Vandebron is a greentech innovator leading the renewable energy transition with innovative solutions through engineering and data.

With more than 250 local sustainable energy sources spread throughout the Netherlands and with more than 200,000 connected households, we are well on the way to achieve our mission. At Vandebron we do things different. It is not just about dreams: we really want to bring change. We want to bring change by making the world more sustainable and we are all working hard to achieve that.

In this challenge you will help to develop our Electric Vehicles (EV) pool management. 

Given a sample of EV charging sessions (`datetime_start`, `datetime_end`, `kWh_charged`), the objective is to model when and for how long the EVs in our portfolio charge from the grid.
