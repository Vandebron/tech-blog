At Vandebron we do things different. It is not just about dreams: we really want to bring change. We want to bring change by making the world more sustainable and we are all working hard to achieve that.

In this challenge you will help to develop our Electric Vehicles (EV) pool management. 

Given a sample of EV charging sessions, the objective is to model when and for how long the EVs in our portfolio charge from the grid. 

**Technology:**

You will use data from 480K of our sessions, in the format:

```
## # A tibble: 500,000 x 3
##    timestamp_start timestamp_end kwh_charged
##              <dbl>         <dbl>       <dbl>
