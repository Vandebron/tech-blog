# Vandebron The Video Game: A Hackathon Journey into the Energy Transition

During a recent hackathon, we set out to gamify one of the most pressing challenges of our time: the transition to green energy. 
What emerged was an interactive game designed to educate players about the complexities of energy grid management in a fun and manageable way 
(very debatable if it is fun or well-balanced, was a hackathon after all)

Let’s dive into the vision, mechanics, and what we hope players take away from this experience.

### Vision: Educate Through Play
Our goal was to create more than just a game. We envisioned a tool that serves as an onboarding experience, 
for both new colleagues and also customers to the energy transition concepts in an engaging way through play.

To realize this vision we chose to go with Godot as our game engine of choice. 
It is a free and open-source game engine that is easy to use and has a fast-growing community of passionate developers. 
It is a fantastic tool that allowed us to quickly prototype and iterate on our game mechanics.

### The Core Gameplay Loop: Keeping the Grid Balanced
In this game, your primary goal is to maintain the energy grid within the "goldilocks zone" not too much power, not too little. The longer you can achieve this, the better!

#### Key Concepts:
- Keeping within the goldilocks zone, energy in must match energy out. Fall outside the goldilocks zone, and the grid becomes unstable. If it is unstable for too long, then it's game over.
- Keeping up with demand: Houses are automatically built over time, mimicking real-life construction. It’s up to the player to manually add renewable energy assets, like wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries, to continue to meet demand.
- Forecasting: Players can use forecasts to anticipate and plan for energy production challenges.
- Curtailment: Too much energy? Players must decide when to turn off assets to avoid overproduction. This introduces the concept of curtailment and highlights the work often required in grid management, due to not being able to store the excess energy.
- The Main Goal: A 100% Green Energy Grid, 100% of the time.

What does success look like in the game? Maintaining the grid with 100% green power for as long as possible, via strategically managing energy production and curtailment to ensure sustainability.
Players experience the dual challenge of meeting growing energy demands and avoiding excess production, a dilemma central to real-world energy grids.

Whether you’re a gamer, an energy enthusiast, or someone entirely new to the topic, we hope this game sparks your interest in the energy transition :)
